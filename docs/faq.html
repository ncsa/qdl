<dd>It refers to navigational bearings (taken in a regular and precise way
                and are essential for proper aviation.) It is so easy to code quickly and easily that
                it also is humorously referred to as &quot;quick and dirty language&quot;.

<dd>
                
<p>The basic philosophies are:
                    <br /></br>
                    * Small is beautiful
                    <br /></br>
                    * Aim at probabilities (what you are likely to do) not possibilities (edge cases)
                    <br /></br>
                    * Simple things should be simple

<dt><a name="Executive_summary">In a nutshell, how does it work?</a></dt>
<dd>QDL is a functional programming language that works on aggregates. It is
                a fairly direct outgrowth of <b>Church's &#x3bb;-calculus</b> and also satisfies
                the <b>B&#xf6;hm-Jacopini Theorem</b>, viz., it has the correct control
                structures to allow structured programming as well, hence is also
                doubly Turing-complete. Why do that? It can be a pain in the neck
                in practice to have precisely one way to do everything.
                (Remember that the promise and curse of Java is that <i>everything</i> is an object?)
                Therefore, QDL has standard procedural statements (such
                as for looping, switches, etc.) and such.
            
<p align="right"><a href="#top">[top]</a></p><hr /></dd>
<dt><a name="origin">Where did QDL come from?</a></dt>
<dd>
                
<p>
                    QDL originated as a very high-level, language independent description
                    of algorithms. Eventually it acquired an implementation to help with
                    development. It's first great application was as a
                    server-side scripting tool for Open Authorization
                    servers. There, the protocols are fixed and dictate various information flows,
                    but can be messy to implement. On top of this there any
                    number of special cases are requirements in how the protocol is used. So either
               </p>
                
<ul>
                    
<li>one is constantly tweaking the server code or</li>
                    
<li>one fixes it to run the bare-bone protocol and has a scripting language</li>
               </ul>
                
<p>that can be invoked at regular intervals in processing to handle the special cases.</p>

<dt><a name="comparison">Can you give an example showing QDL vs. another language?</a></dt>
<dd>An easy one is to fill an array of doubles with acos(sin(x)) for 1,000
                values in the range -1 up to, but not including 1. In Java:

                
<div>
<pre>
                    int n = 1000;
                    double[] values = new double[n];
                    for(int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++){
                    // Note the trick: You have indices that don't match up to values, so you must
                    // compute them. On top of this, if you divide an integer by and integer in Java, you get
                    // an integer, hence you must divide by 500.0 and on top of it, you want to ensure that it is
                    // a double, so you must append a &quot;d&quot; to force the issue
                      values[i] = Math.acos(Math.sin(i/500.0d -1));
                    }
               </pre></div>
                We can contrast this with QDL:

                
<div>
<pre>
                    values. := acos(sin([-1;1;1/500]));
               </pre></div>

                
<p>Yes indeed. That's it. This tells QDL to start at -1 and increment by 1/500 (the
                expression in the brackets is called a slice). You could even
                    use an alternate slice operator and just specify the number of elements you want.</p>
                
<div>
<pre>
                    values. := acos(sin([|-1;1;1000|]));
               </pre></div>
                
<p>which tells QDL to make 1000 elements evenly distributed between -1 and 1 inclusive.
                And what if you needed to do this with higher precision, say to 25 decimal places? In Java
                you need to switch all of your variables over to BigDecimals and find some libraries that
                    support them. In QDL you just set the precision:</p>
                
<div>
<pre>
                    numeric_digits(25)
               </pre></div>
                
<p>and re-run the command.</p>
            
<p align="right"><a href="#top">[top]</a></p><hr /></dd>
<dt><a name="workspace">What is the workspace model?</a></dt>
<dd>The workspace (aka WS) is a basic unit of work organization. It is
                an interactive shell that allows for managing QDL development. In short,
                it is QDL's IDE. Workspaces can be saved with their current state as
                a snapshot, then reloaded. They are also portable, so you can share them with
                others. This allows you to create a workspace per project
                and keep everything available. In cases where you may have large gaps in activity
                (a very common case), you can simply load the workspace for that project and
                instantly resume what you were doing.

<dt><a name="stems_and_what_not">What's the deal with stems? What makes them different from an array?</a></dt>
<dd>Stems are generally referred to as an &quot;associative array&quot; whose keys may be
                strings or integers. If strings only, this is effectively a map. If integers, it is a list.

                Probably the most interesting thing is that operations are done on aggregates, which
                renders much of a program&#x2019;s control structure implicit. You mostly have operators that
                describe what you want to happen to the data and it just occurs.

                On top of that, there are functions like query() which let you use JSON Path to interrogate
                the contents of a stem and the extraction operator, \, which lets you dissect one. A common
                happenstance is getting some enormous JSON blob and having to dissect it for useful information.
                QDL makes this quite easy.

<dt><a name="why_not_other_languages">Why use QDL for server side scripting?</a></dt>
<dd>
                
<p>There are many high-level languages that could have been used, such as Java,
                    Python, Ruby etc. Here are the major reasons for using QDL:
               </p>
                
<p>On an OAuth server, there are many -- possibly thousands -- of clients. Under OA4MP, which
                    handles identity management and single sign-on, each of these may have imposing
                    institutional uses, restrictions and
                    requirements. So, allowing clients to upload their Java code (OA4MP is written in Java) to the
                    server
                    is a non-starter. QDL behaves very nicely as a security policy langugage.
               </p>
                
<p>Unlike SAML, it is a language,
                    because it may require quite specific decision making -- to use SAML would require some way of
                    creating valid SAML on the fly which means eventually creating some other language just for that.
                    Work is a conserved quantity.
               </p>
                
<p>
                    As such, most server-side code is quite terse (very good for an administrator to look at and vet
                    before accepting it) and quite easy to write. Most QDL on a server is a couple of lines and
                    implicit looping plus aggregate operations allow a lot to be done by more or less making
                    qualitative statements about the data.
               </p>
            
<p align="right"><a href="#top">[top]</a></p><hr /></dd>
<dt><a name="conceptual">What is the hardest conceptual hurdle in using QDL?</a></dt>
<dd>
                
<p>Aggregates, aka stem variables. These are written with a trailing period, hence
                    in QDL, <b>my_variable.</b> is a stem. Basic operations follow the
                    &quot;freshman algebra&quot; paradigm that every operator is linear,
                    <i>i.e.</i>
                    functions are applied to each element. So to take the
                    square root of every element in the above stem, you would just write
                    something like
               </p>
                
<div>
<pre>
                    my_variable. := sqrt(my_variable.);
               </pre></div>
                
<p>Once you get the knack of it though, it is very easy to work with data
                    and mostly you tell QDL what you want to happen to your data and it does it.
                    This can immensely streamline what would be large chunks of code in other
                    languages.
               </p>
                
<p>A good comparison is in the
                    <a class="externalLink" href="https://qdl-lang.org/pdf/qdl_reference.pdf">reference manual</a>
                    with Armstrong numbers. Just search for Armstrong there.
               </p>
            
<p align="right"><a href="#top">[top]</a></p><hr /></dd>
<dt><a name="subsetting">What is subsetting?</a></dt>
<dd>Since operations happen on stems element-wise, operations are only done
                on corresponding elements with the same index. This means you always will get
                a (possibly improper) subset of the indices.
                <i>E.g.</i>
                
<div>
<pre>
                    a. := [;10]; // 10 elements, 0,1,...,9
                    b. := [;4]*2; // 4 elements, values are 0,2,4,6
                    a.^b.; // raise each element of a. to corresponding power in b.
                    [1,1,16,729]
               </pre></div>
                
<p>In this case, since there are only 4 elements, in b., only 4 elements get returned.</p>
                
<p>The reason for this is quite practical. We <i>could</i> do something like supply
                    missing default values (actually, most languages do), but that would mean that the system
                    is, in essence, generating data. That is a big no-no. If you do an operation on some stems
                    and the result is smaller than you suspect, that tells you straight off the bat your
                    inputs were off.
